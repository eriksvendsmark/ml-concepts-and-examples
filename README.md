The `models/` directory contains subfolders for different categories of machine learning. Within each, Jupyter notebooks provide:
- A brief conceptual overview of each model
- Essential mathematical insights
- A simple, illustrative code example

This repository is publicly available to facilitate learning and sharing. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

Enjoy exploring!
